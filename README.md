# BookshelfCMS_Alpha
This creates static sites that have book-like readability with off-host metadata

This has been used to generate a number of the stories for Werebooks.org with success. It should work well enough now.
Unfortunately, WereBooks Limited is being dissolved, so this project is becoming community supported.

If you choose to use and tweak it, we'd love to see the sites you made!
