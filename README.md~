# DevBlog CMS
Creates static sites for developers with off-host metadata

This is based on the BookshelfCMS_Alpha by WereBooks, adapted to a developer blog that is shared between multiple people on a team.

Typically requires the installation of the Template, JSON, and Roman perl modules
(these can be simply installed from CPAN or via apt, with sudo apt install libjson-perl libtemplate-perl libroman-perl)

The other perl libs used are generally pre-installed, but all dependencies are listed here for reference:
POSIX
Getopt::Long
Exporter
JSON
File::Path
File::Spec;
File::Copy;
Template;
Data::Dumper;
